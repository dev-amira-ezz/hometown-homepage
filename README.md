# Hometown-homepage
This project is a part of the scrimba.com front-end web development tutorial.
The content is about my hometown (Alexandria, Egypt).
This is a solo project where I did all the coding from scratch.
I followed a Figma design and then changed some details like the color pallette and fonts.
I also added a navigation bar.
